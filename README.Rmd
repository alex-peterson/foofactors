##Welcome to the Foofactors Package!

This Alex Peterson's version of a practice package for [STAT 545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io).

For how to use the foofactors package, see the [vignette](https://github.com/alex-peterson/foofactors/blob/master/vignettes/hello-foofactors.Rmd)

The foofactors package comes with four functions: 

* fbind() binds together factors without turning them into weird integer things
* freq_out() creates a frequency table for the factor
* fcheck() determines if the factor vector should really be a character vector
* forder() allows you to reorder your factors

Go ahead and install the package and see if it works!
